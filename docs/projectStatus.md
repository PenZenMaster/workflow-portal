## Resume From

Last session: 2026-06-12
Last commit: 418d09a feat(prompts): add platform metadata CRUD routes — v1.7.0
Branch: main | Version: v1.7.0 | 515 tests passing
Production: v1.4.0 - v1.6.1 deployed to pre-production, QA passed. v1.6.0 verified
live: Salvo Metal Works AI Share of Voice now reads 88.5% (previously 153%) after
re-parsing runs 6-8 and the aggregate-snapshot-daily job completing. TD-14 fix
confirmed live. v1.6.1 (TD-15 + sentimentStore cross-client leak fix) deployed and
QA passed. v1.7.0 packaged this session, not yet deployed.

v1.3.0 deploy follow-ups (brand_aliases backfill, Salvo runs 6 & 7 re-parse, /admin/jobs
health check) — all completed during v1.3.0 QA.

Pick up from:
1. Deploy v1.7.0 to pre-production (B-11 Phase 1 backend platform CRUD).
2. B-11 Phase 2 (frontend): admin "AI Platforms" page (super_admin/agency_admin nav
   link) — list platforms with displayName/slug/enabled toggle and
   Connected/Not-configured badge (from `config.configuredPlatforms`), edit dialog,
   add-custom-platform dialog, delete with 409 PLATFORM_IN_USE handling. Also extend
   Integrations.tsx to show connection status for all 5 target LLMs.
3. Continue internal review of the consolidated AI Visibility client page
   (Overview/Mentions/SoV/Sentiment/Sources/Recommendations/Traffic now inline
   on ClientDetail) before exposing pre-production to clients.
4. See Tech Debt Register and Backlog below for next priorities.

## Post-Sprint Work This Session (v1.7.0)

- Feature (B-11 Phase 1): backend CRUD for LLM platform metadata.
  - shared/schema.ts: added `insertPlatformSchema` (slug regex
    `^[a-z0-9-]+$`, displayName, optional config) and `updatePlatformSchema`
    (displayName/enabled/config all optional).
  - server/storage/platformStore.ts: added `getBySlug`, `create`, `update`,
    `delete`, `countResponses` to `IPlatformStore`/`PlatformStore`.
  - server/routes/prompts.ts: added `POST /api/platforms` (400 validation, 409
    DUPLICATE_SLUG, 201), `PATCH /api/platforms/:id` (404 PLATFORM_NOT_FOUND, 200),
    `DELETE /api/platforms/:id` (404, 409 PLATFORM_IN_USE when countResponses > 0,
    204) — all gated to ADMIN_ROLES.
  - tests/server/_helpers/buildAuthApp.ts: added the same AppError-aware error
    handler used in server/index.ts so route tests can assert on `res.body.code`.
  - tests/server/storage/prompts.test.ts: 11 new PlatformStore tests (29/29 passing).
  - tests/server/prompts.routes.test.ts: 12 new route tests for POST/PATCH/DELETE
    /api/platforms (36/36 passing).
  - 515 tests passing (25 new). API keys remain in .env/cPanel env vars — this CRUD
    only manages platform metadata (slug/displayName/enabled/config).
  - Phase 2 (frontend) not started — see B-11 in Backlog.

## Post-Sprint Work This Session (v1.6.1)

- Fix (TD-15 + related): `citationStore.listByClient()` and
  `sentimentStore.listByClient()` / `sentimentStore.getReviewQueue()` all returned
  their entire underlying table (`response_citations` / `response_sentiment`)
  regardless of the `clientId` argument — identical cross-client data leak pattern to
  the `mentionStore.listByClient()` bug fixed in v1.4.2. This affected the Citation
  Sources, Sentiment, and Recommendations sections on ClientDetail (every client saw
  every other client's citations and sentiment rows).
  - server/storage/citationStore.ts: listByClient now joins
    response_citations -> responses_raw -> prompt_runs and filters by
    prompt_runs.client_id (same pattern as mentionStore).
  - server/storage/sentimentStore.ts: listByClient and getReviewQueue both gain the
    same join + client_id filter; getReviewQueue also still filters by confidence
    threshold and no override.
  - tests/server/storage/metrics.test.ts: new CitationStore "listByClient returns
    only citations belonging to that client's runs" test.
  - tests/server/storage/sentiments.test.ts: rewrote fixtures to seed real
    run/response rows (required for the new join); added "listByClient returns only
    sentiment belonging to that client's runs" and updated "getReviewQueue" test for
    multi-client isolation.
  - 490 tests passing (2 new).
  - Not yet deployed.

## Post-Sprint Work This Session (v1.6.0)

- Fix: AI Share of Voice could exceed 100% (reported as 153% for Salvo Metal Works).
  Root cause: `computeAISoV(mentionCount, allBrandMentions)` divided two incompatible
  units — `mentionCount` counts *responses* where the client brand was mentioned OR
  cited (including citation-only responses with zero `response_mentions` rows), while
  `allBrandMentions` counts raw `response_mentions` *rows* across all brands. Mixing a
  response-count numerator with a row-count denominator allowed the ratio to exceed
  100%.
  - shared/schema.ts: added `clientBrandMentions` column to `metricSnapshotsDaily` +
    `MetricSnapshotDaily` type. Migration 0010_cute_malice.sql.
  - server/storage.ts: SCHEMA_SQL (in-memory test DB) gains `client_brand_mentions`.
  - server/storage/metricStore.ts: hydrate(), AggregateResult, upsert(), and
    aggregateForPeriod() all carry `clientBrandMentions` / `totalClientBrandMentions`.
  - server/jobs/handlers.ts (aggregate-snapshot-daily): now also tallies
    `clientBrandMentions` — the raw `response_mentions` row count where
    `brandId === clientBrand.id` — across all completed responses.
  - server/routes/metrics.ts: Overview, trend (`aiSoV` case), and `/sov` all derive
    AI SoV from `totalClientBrandMentions` / `clientBrandMentions` instead of
    `totalMentions` / `mentionCount`. Both numerator and denominator are now raw
    mention-row counts, so AI SoV cannot exceed 100%.
  - docs/system-documentation.md Section 2.2 AI SoV "Data sources" updated to describe
    the corrected formula.
  - tests/server/storage/metrics.test.ts + tests/server/metrics.routes.test.ts: 3 new
    tests (TDD — confirmed failing before implementation). 488 tests passing.
  - Not yet deployed.

## Post-Sprint Work This Session (v1.5.0)

- Feature: Re-parse progress/completion feedback on RunDetail
  (client/src/pages/ai/RunDetail.tsx). Previously, clicking "Re-parse responses"
  only showed a toast — there was no way to tell whether the async parse-response
  jobs were still running or had finished.
  - server/storage/jobStore.ts: new `listByKindAndResponseIds(kind, responseIds,
    sinceTs)` — finds jobs of a given kind whose JSON payload.responseId is in the
    given set, created at/after sinceTs.
  - server/routes/runs.ts: new `GET /api/runs/:id/reparse-status?since=<ts>`
    (EDITOR_ROLES) — returns `{ total, queued, running, done, failed, cancelled }`
    counts of parse-response jobs for the run's responses since `since`.
  - client/src/pages/ai/reparseStatus.ts (new): pure helpers
    `isReparseComplete()` / `reparseProgressLabel()`.
  - RunDetail.tsx: on re-parse trigger, records `since = Date.now()` and polls
    reparse-status every 3s; shows a "Re-parsing responses: X/N done" banner,
    then "Re-parse complete" and auto-invalidates this client's AI Visibility
    queries (Overview/Mentions/SoV/Sentiment) so sections refresh without a
    manual reload.
  - tests/server/storage/jobStore.test.ts, tests/server/runs.routes.test.ts,
    client/src/pages/ai/reparseStatus.test.ts: 8 new tests (TDD — confirmed
    failing before implementation). 485 tests passing.
  - docs/system-documentation.md Section 1B Step 7 updated to describe the new
    progress banner.
  - Not yet deployed.

### TD-14 root cause (confirmed via read-only prod.data.db copy)

`brand_aliases` for Salvo Metal Works' own brand (brand_id=4, client_id=4) is
**empty** in production — not even the canonical name "Salvo Metal Works" is
registered as a searchable alias. This is why run 6 has 8/10 responses with a
client-owned citation but 0/10 with a brand mention (all_brand_mentions=0):
the parser had nothing to match against.

Run 7 currently shows 8 mention rows for brand_id=4 despite the alias table
being empty *now* — meaning an alias existed at the time run 7 was
parsed/re-parsed and was later removed. The v1.2.8 alias auto-seed + backfill
was applied to a local copy of prod.data.db during that session but appears to
never have reached live production (or was subsequently lost).

Fix in progress (data-only, via portal UI per system-documentation.md Section
1B Step 3): add alias "Salvo Metal Works" (exact) to brand_id=4, then use
Re-parse responses on runs 6, 7, and 8.

Separately noted: live Overview reports 3 runs (6-8) / ~60 responses for
Salvo, but the downloaded prod.data.db snapshot only contained runs 6-7 (20
responses) — likely the download predates run 8's completion. Re-verify
counts after the alias fix + re-parse.

## Post-Sprint Work This Session (v1.4.2)

- Fixed `mentionStore.listByClient()` (server/storage/mentionStore.ts), found during
  AI Visibility QA on Salvo Metal Works (clientId=4): Overview showed Mention Rate =
  78.3% (driven by citation-only responses, hasCitation OR hasMention) while the
  Mentions section showed "No mentions detected yet" — the route returned the ENTIRE
  response_mentions table unfiltered (the `clientId` parameter was unused/prefixed
  `_clientId` since Sprint 4). Now joins response_mentions -> responses_raw ->
  prompt_runs and filters by `prompt_runs.client_id`.
  - tests/server/storage/metrics.test.ts: new test confirms mentions from another
    client's runs are excluded. 477 tests passing (1 new).
  - Noted but NOT fixed in this change: `citationStore.listByClient()` has the
    identical unfiltered-table pattern (server/storage/citationStore.ts:58-63) —
    tracked as TD-15.
  - Not yet deployed.

## Post-Sprint Work This Session (v1.4.1)

- Fixed metric_snapshots_daily overview aggregation bug found during AI Visibility
  QA on Salvo Metal Works (clientId=4): Overview showed Citation Frequency and
  Mention Rate both as 78.3%, inflated by double-counting. `aggregate-snapshot-daily`
  (server/jobs/handlers.ts) recomputes lifetime cumulative totals on every run and
  stores them in the snapshot row for "today" — so each row holds an all-time total
  as of its date, not a daily delta. `metricStore.aggregateForPeriod` was SUM()-ing
  every snapshot row in the requested date range, re-adding totals already subsumed
  by later rows.
  - server/storage/metricStore.ts: aggregateForPeriod now returns the delta between
    the latest snapshot at/before toDate and the latest snapshot strictly before
    fromDate (0 if no baseline exists), instead of summing all rows in range.
  - server/jobs/handlers.ts: corrected misleading "Aggregate today's completed
    responses" comment to describe the actual cumulative-recompute behavior.
  - tests/server/storage/metrics.test.ts: updated existing aggregation test to the
    new delta semantics; added 2 new tests covering the cumulative double-count
    scenario and baseline subtraction. 476 tests passing (2 new).
  - Not yet deployed.

## Post-Sprint Work This Session (v1.4.0)

- v1.4.0 (AI Visibility Page Consolidation): merged the 7 separate report routes
  (Overview, Mentions, Share of Voice, Sentiment, Sources, Recommendations, Traffic)
  into inline sections on ClientDetail (client/src/pages/ai/sections/*) for a
  single-page view. Reports, Prompt Collections, Runs, and Integrations remain as
  top nav buttons. Removed the now-redundant standalone page routes from App.tsx.
  Added ClientDetail.test.tsx smoke test (TDD: written first, confirmed failing,
  then implementation made it pass). 474 tests passing (3 new).
  Deployed to pre-production and passed internal QA — not yet exposed to clients.

## Post-Sprint Work Previous Session (v1.2.8 – v1.3.0)

- v1.2.8: Root-caused Salvo "no AI Visibility data" report to brand_aliases table being
  empty for all brands (parser only matches against brand.aliases). Fixed by
  auto-seeding an exact-match alias from canonicalName on brand/competitor creation
  (server/routes/clients.ts). Backfilled aliases for the 4 existing brands in a local
  prod.data.db copy.
- v1.3.0 (Job Runner Monitoring, Instrumentation & Manual Recovery): found 15 jobs from
  Salvo run 7 stuck 9+ days because rescueOrphans() only ran on process start, not per
  tick, with zero visibility into queue health.
  - server/jobs/runner.ts: rescueOrphans() now runs every tick (self-healing);
    added getHealth() heartbeat (lastTickAt, intervalMs, running) + log instrumentation
  - shared/schema.ts: JOB_STATUSES/JobStatus/Job types (adds "cancelled")
  - server/storage/jobStore.ts (new): list/filter, countByStatus, listHung, requeue, cancel
  - server/routes/jobs.ts (new): GET /api/jobs, GET /api/jobs/health,
    POST /api/jobs/:id/requeue, POST /api/jobs/:id/cancel, POST /api/jobs/rescue —
    all super_admin only
  - client/src/pages/admin/Jobs.tsx (new): health banner, status chips, jobs table
    with Requeue/Cancel actions, "Rescue hung jobs" button, polls every 5s; wired at
    /admin/jobs with nav link in Home
  - Verified live against local prod.data.db copy: starting the server auto-drained
    all 15 stuck run-7 jobs and produced 8 new response_mentions rows
  - 471 tests passing (29 new: 2 runner, 9 jobStore, 16 jobs routes, 2 clients alias)

## Post-Sprint Work Previous Session (v1.2.1 – v1.2.7)

- v1.2.1: Replaced ai-visibility-reporting-spec.md with aeo_geo_google_data_architecture.md as guiding architecture doc; merged PR #1 (feature/ai-visibility-module → main)
- v1.2.2–v1.2.6: GA4 OAuth popup flow — fixed CSP inline-script block, hash routing, COOP header severing window.opener; final solution uses server-side polling from main window (no cross-window messaging)
- v1.2.7: Prompt category taxonomy reworked to 5 groups: Brand/Entity, Category/Commercial Intent, Local/Regional, Comparison/Evaluation, Reputation; GA4 connected and verified (4 AI sessions showing on Traffic page)

## Post-Sprint Work Previous Session (v1.1.0 – v1.2.0)

- v1.1.0: Fixed critical pipeline bug — prompt-run was not enqueuing parse-response; added Re-parse button on RunDetail
- v1.1.1: Reordered ClientDetail nav; added system-documentation.md; added New Export button on Reports page
- v1.2.0: Multi-LLM adapters (OpenAI/ChatGPT, Anthropic/Claude, Gemini, Groq/Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek); platform seeding fixed (INSERT OR IGNORE per slug); platform multi-select on Trigger Run / Run Now; GA4 referrer list expanded to 30+ domains; monthly stacked bar chart on Traffic page

## Current Sprint — AI Visibility Sprint 7 — GA4 + Calibration + v1.0.0

**Goal:** AI referral traffic stitched into reports; calibration harness against a manual audit set; v1.0.0 cut.
**Status: COMPLETE**
**Version: v1.2.0 (includes post-sprint fixes and multi-LLM feature)**

## Tech Debt Register

| ID  | Severity | Status | Description | File |
|-----|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| TD-10 | Medium | Done | Session error callbacks lack request context in logs | server/routes/auth.ts |
| TD-12 | Low | Open | Hardcoded seed data — no versioning or rollback | server/seed.ts |
| TD-13 | Low | Open | skipLibCheck: true masks dep type errors | tsconfig.json |
| TD-14 | Medium | Done | Salvo (clientId=4) run 6: 8/10 responses had a client-owned citation but zero client-brand mentions detected (all_brand_mentions=0). Root cause: brand_aliases for brand_id=4 was empty in production (v1.2.8 backfill never reached live data.db). Fixed (data-only) by adding the "Salvo Metal Works" alias via portal UI and re-parsing runs 6-8; verified live in v1.6.0 (AI SoV now 88.5%, down from an impossible 153%). | server/services/parser.ts |
| TD-15 | Medium | Done | citationStore.listByClient, sentimentStore.listByClient, and sentimentStore.getReviewQueue all ignored their clientId parameter and returned the full response_citations / response_sentiment tables across all clients (same pattern fixed for mentionStore in v1.4.2). Fixed in v1.6.1 by joining responses_raw -> prompt_runs and filtering by client_id; feeds Citation Sources, Sentiment, and Recommendations sections on ClientDetail. | server/storage/citationStore.ts, server/storage/sentimentStore.ts |

## Backlog (post-AI-module)

### High Priority
- B-11 Feature: LLM integrations CRUD — add a mechanism to create/read/update/delete
  LLM platform integrations. Target LLMs: ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and Google
  AI (Gemini). **Phase 1 (backend CRUD, v1.7.0) COMPLETE** — API keys stay in
  .env/cPanel env vars; CRUD applies to platform metadata only (slug, displayName,
  enabled, config). Added `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/platforms[/:id]` (ADMIN_ROLES),
  `insertPlatformSchema`/`updatePlatformSchema` in shared/schema.ts, and
  `create`/`update`/`delete`/`getBySlug`/`countResponses` on PlatformStore (delete is
  blocked with 409 PLATFORM_IN_USE if responses reference the platform). **Phase 2
  (frontend — admin "AI Platforms" page, enabled toggle, connection-status badges,
  custom platform add/edit/delete UI) is NOT started.**
- B-12 Feature: AI-assisted prompt generation for Prompt Collections — when a Prompt
  Collection is created, offer the user an option to have AI research and generate
  prompts using the client's Brand, website URL, and configured competitors. Generated
  prompts should be grouped by type:
  | Prompt type | Example |
  |---|---|
  | Informational | "What is the best way to solve X?" |
  | Comparative | "Brand A vs Brand B" |
  | Commercial | "Best software for X" |
  | Local | "Best emergency plumber near Seattle" |
  | Problem-aware | "Why is my furnace making noise?" |
  | Alternative | "Alternatives to [competitor]" |
- B-13 Feature: Edit existing prompts — add the ability to edit a prompt's text/category
  on an existing Prompt Collection (currently prompts can only be created/removed, not edited).

### Medium Priority
- B-04 Seed data versioning strategy (allow adding/updating workflows without full redeploy)
- B-06 Session store: session expiry cleanup configuration review
- B-15 Investigate mechanism to create a guided workflow to onboard new clients —
  Section 1B of system-documentation.md lists 6 manual setup steps (brands, aliases,
  GA4, prompt collection, run); a wizard/checklist in-app would reduce setup errors
  such as the missing-competitors gap that caused Salvo's AI SoV to read 0%/100%
  (see system-documentation.md Section 1B Step 2 note, added 2026-06-12).

### Low Priority
- B-08 skipLibCheck: false in tsconfig
- B-09 Local dev server fix for Windows (remaining socket/network issues)
- B-10 Evaluate replacing better-sqlite3-session-store (deprecated)
- B-14 Display the app version number (from package.json) in the footer of every page —
  currently Home.tsx has a one-off footer but no shared layout footer exists across routes.
